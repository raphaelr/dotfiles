You may even learn something interesting from them.

Installation

Get this repository by any means neccessary and place it somewhere on your hard drive. Make sure
the submodules are up-to-date by doing a `git submodule init` followed by a tactical
`git submodule update`. Then do one of the following:

Open Powershell, `cd` into the directory with my dotfiles and execute this magnificent command:

Die in a fire.
