------------
Get this repository by any means neccessary and place it somewhere on your hard drive. Make sure
the submodules are up-to-date by doing a `git submodule init` followed by a tactical
`git submodule update`. Make sure ruby is installed, `cd` into this directory and execute
`ruby bootstrap.rb`.
