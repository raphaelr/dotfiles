Raph's amazing dotfiles
=======================
Welcome to my dotfiles repository. Enjoy your stay, take a look around, make yourself comfortable.
You may even learn something interesting from them.

Installation
------------
Get this repository by any means neccessary and place it somewhere on your hard drive. Make sure
the submodules are up-to-date by doing a `git submodule init` followed by a tactical
`git submodule update`. Then do one of the following:

### Windows
Open Powershell, `cd` into the directory with my dotfiles and execute this magnificent command:
`./bootstrap.ps1`

### Linux
Open your favourite shell, make sure that you have a ruby interpreter installed, ´cd´ into the
directory with the dotfiles and enter this extraordinary command: `./bootstrap.rb`

### Mac OS X
Die in a fire.
